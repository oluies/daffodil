/**
 * Diffable is a facility for comparing objects for equality, and providing valuable diagnostic capability
 * when they are different by capturing why they are different.
 * 
 * The theme here is "Design for Test" - unit tests in particular need to compare rich data structures. 
 * Equality will tell you if the test passes or not, but be very little help in isolating why the structures
 * are not equal. Diff fixes this by saving the point at which the structures are different, and returning that
 * as the diagnostic of why they aren't equal.
 * 
 * At a small cost in performance, it is better to implement diff than equals. Equals is realized in terms of diff 
 * for classes that mix in trait Diffable.
 * 
 * If a class does NOT have a diff method, and does not inherit one from a parent class, then it is compared via
 * equals to compute differences.
